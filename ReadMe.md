## Description
A MIPS CPU written in Chisel, I will finish this project in several steps. <br>
I will introduce the project in my [Blog](https://superyanyann.github.io/).<br>
For more details about Chisel,you can see [here](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/).<br>

## Details
### Project1-ALU
the simple 32bits ALU is designed not by the operators like * , / , - ,but a Adder.<br>
for example the MUL is achieved by Booth Encoding and the Adder .<br>
for achievement of Booth Encoding,I learn from [here](https://github.com/were/Chisel-Adder).<br>

### Project2-MulttiCycle
This is a MulttiCycle MIPS CPU by FSM.
